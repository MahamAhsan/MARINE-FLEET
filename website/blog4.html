        <h2>Know Your Needs</h2>
        <p>
          Selecting the perfect yacht starts with understanding what you want from your boating experience. 
          Are you looking for luxury and comfort, or speed and agility? Consider how many guests you plan to host and the typical length of your trips.

        <h2>Types of Yachts</h2>
        <p>
          Yachts come in many varieties: motor yachts, sailing yachts, catamarans, and more. Motor yachts offer power and speed, while sailing yachts provide a more traditional, eco-friendly experience. Catamarans are known for stability and spaciousness.

        <h2>Budget and Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          It's essential to factor in not just the purchase price but also the ongoing maintenance, mooring fees, insurance, and crew costs if applicable.
